                Mam Tor, also known as the 'Mother Hill', is a 517 m (1,696 ft) peak, located near
                Castleton. You can hike it or mountain bike it using the trail along the ridge line.
                Its close proximity to Castleton means you can stay there overnight, and get food
                from the pubs. In terms of parking, there is minimal parking available nearby, so
                you may want to park further down the hill at the Rushup Edge car park.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-white mb-20">
                Castleton, famous for its caves, is a town with plenty to do. There is lots of
                parking and many places to eat. You can use the town as a base to explore the caves,
                maybe visit Mam Tor and hike some of the other surrounding hills, and accommodation
                is available as well.

            <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-white mb-20">
                Kinder Downfall is a mighty waterfall located on the top of the Kinder Scout
                ridgeline. For maximum views, try to go after it has been raining a lot, not during
                a heatwave :) Parking is available all around the ridgeline in various places,
                including the small town of Hayfield, and the even smaller town of Little Hayfield.
                On Kinder Road, you can find a camp site, public toilets and a car park which
                sometimes has a food truck. There are also a couple of pubs further into Hayfield.

            <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-white mb-20">
                Buxton is another town which makes a great day trip. It has plenty of car parking
                and green/park space, as well as the historic architecture and surrounding views.
                There are also lots of shops and pubs available to keep you going :)

            <p class="mt-8 text-lg text-white mb-20">
                Bamford Edge is located right next to Ladybower Reservoir. This makes for amazing
                views, especially sunsets and sunrises. Although it isn't one to stop off at all
                day, you can park in the Heatherdene car park at the bottom of the hill and stop off
                for some food (you'll need to take your own), use the public toilets, and make the
                short but steep hike to the top of the hill. There are also a couple of pubs nearby.
